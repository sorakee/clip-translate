# clip-translate
Some app I developed because I want to read some Japanese comments on X/Twitter without Google's Translator failing on me.<br/>
Works well with Textractor or other third party apps that retrieve text from games, video, etc too!<br/>
You can modify the system prompt to help you add extra information that may help you learn Japanese I guess.
